# MNIST Image Classification

This project implements an image classification model to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The model is built with machine learning algorithms and uses Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9). The dataset is divided into:
- **Training set**: 60,000 images
- **Test set**: 10,000 images

Each image is 28x28 pixels and is labeled with the digit it represents.

## Project Overview

In this project, we will:
1. Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset.
2. Train a classification model using various algorithms.
3. Evaluate the model's performance.
4. Visualize the results.

- Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`

You can install the required libraries using the following:
